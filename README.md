## 🚀 Overview

This is a **Content-Based Product Recommendation System** built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It analyzes product features and recommends similar products based on user selection. The system uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to identify and suggest the most relevant alternatives.

The application is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and scalable — ideal for startups and small businesses aiming to personalize user experience and increase sales conversions.

> 📍 Built with a clean, minimal frontend using **Streamlit**.
